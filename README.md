# TaskMangement

This task management system was created during my internship at Aegis Ltd.
Using a human centered approach this tool was developed for the in house software developers at Aegis.

The tool has two access levels, one for a manager and another for software developers.
Accounts can be created by signing up but are only accessible after a manager approves the user.

The managers have the ability to add and delete developer access users, view project & developer status, update project status, allocate/realloacte projects to developers and view project history by looking up using filters.

The developers have the ability to view allocated projects, create, view and update tasks for each project, update project status and view task history for a chosen project.

All users can modify personal information.
